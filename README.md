# Bigmart-Sales-prediction

-->Problem statement:
The data scientists at BigMart have collected 2013 sales data for 1559 products across 10 stores in different cities. Also, certain attributes of each product and store have been defined. The aim is to build a predictive model and find out the sales of each product at a particular store.
Using this model, BigMart will try to understand the properties of products and stores which play a key role in increasing sales.
  
-->Thus, based on the properties of a product and a store,sales of a product is impacted. The idea is to find out what these properties are and how to increase sales.

-->The models used are Linear Regression, Ridge Regression and random Forest.

-->The problem is explored in five stages: 
    i. Hypothesis generation
    ii. Data Exploration
    iii. Data Cleaning
    iv. Feature Engineering
    v. Construction of Model
